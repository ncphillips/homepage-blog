A lot of developers think that tests are about red/green
   * TDD is not just writing tests first

* Tests are documentation
* Tests tell about quality of code
* Tests tell me what I missed
    * Rule most developers forget, a production defect is a test you didnt write
* Tests Tell me where I left off

* Quality over Quantity
    * Seeing X% code coverage required even with no quality check
    * reminds me of the old days when quality of developer was measured in lines of code written
