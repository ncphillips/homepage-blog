Testing is hard. For many developers the barrier to entry into testing is hard. A lot of the information out there dives right into the testing part of things and skips some of the simple rules of testing. Many of the developers I talk to seem to all have the same problems: their code is too large, expensive to change or code has dependencies that make it impossible to test. With TDD, BDD, JUnit, RSpec, Jasmine, or any other testing idea/framework the choices are not always easy and can be intemedating for a new developer looking to learn more about testing.  like how to make your code testable. The 3 part series will dive into some ideas to help you write better code without any complications.
