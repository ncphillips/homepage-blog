For many developers the barrier to entry into testing is hard. A lot of the information out there dives right into the testing part of things and skips some of the simple rules of testing. Many of the developers I talk to seem to all have the same problems: their code is too large, expensive to change or code has dependencies that make it impossible to test. With TDD, BDD, JUnit, RSpec, Jasmine, or any other testing idea/framework the choices are not always easy and can be intemedating for a new developer looking to learn more about testing. The 3 part series will dive into some ideas to help you write better code without any complications.

For the series we will forget tests exist. Let's focus on how we can write our code so it is easier to read, easier to write and overall less stressful to change. In the first part of this series we will look at self documenting code
